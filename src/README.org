#+TITLE: ox-tufte
#+AUTHOR: The Bayesians Inc.

This is an [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Exporting.html#index-export-back_002dend][export backend for Org mode]] that exports buffers to HTML that is
compatible with [[https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/][Tufte CSS]].

* Changes since version 3.x
Version 4.x alters some of the internals considerably from the 3.x version.
Notably some configuration options have changed.  See below for details.

- Altering variables =org-html-checkbox-type= and =org-html-divs= no longer has
  any effect.  To provide default values for the corresponding options, use
  variables =org-tufte-html-checkbox-type= and =org-tufte-html-sections=
  respectively.  The properties are still called =:html-checkbox-type= and
  =:html-divs=, however.
- Similarly, =HTML_DOCTYPE= (as well, variable =org-html-doctype= and property
  =:html-doctype=) and =HTML_CONTAINER= (as well, variable
  =org-html-container-element= and property =:html-container=) keywords and
  =html5-fancy= option (as well, variable =org-html-html5-fancy= and property
  =:html-html5-fancy=) are disabled.  Altering these values from the defaults is
  not supported.
- The =tufte-html= backend definition makes explicit the options that it
  overrides compared to the =html= backend.
- New command =org-tufte-convert-region-to-html= added.
- Invoking =org-export-string-as= now works ([[https://github.com/ox-tufte/ox-tufte/issues/22][#22]]).
- Loading =ox-tufte= now advises =org-export-as=.  For advanced uses, the depth
  of the installed advice is user-configurable via =setopt= (see
  =org-tufte-export-as-advice-depth=).
* Introduction
[[https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/][Tufte CSS]] has visually appealing defaults for webpages and supports (among other
things) margin and side notes. Unfortunately, /Tufte CSS/ makes a number of
demands of the HTML structure. This is a pity, because the HTML generated by
=ox-html= breaks some of those assumptions (of =tufte-css=). Using =ox-tufte=
you can avail the features of =tufte-css= when exporting an org-mode file to
HTML. Since version 2+, the design goal of =ox-tufte= has been to *minimally*
change the HTML structure generated by =ox-html= (with additional CSS as needed)
to get behaviour that is equivalent to =tufte-css=.

=ox-tufte= tries very hard to not introduce additional constraints (over and
above those imposed by =ox-html= and =tufte-css=) for users. In fact, work on
=ox-tufte= [[https://github.com/ox-tufte/ox-tufte/milestone/1][version 2]] began after noticing that:
- =ox-tufte= was broken and didn't faithfully reproduce the =tufte-css=
  experience.
- [[https://github.com/Zilong-Li/org-tufte][org-tufte]] made additional assumptions and was too opinionated. E.g.,
  - deviations from =ox-html=
    - [[https://github.com/Zilong-Li/org-tufte/blob/404ab1286139ea6cbdc00bb1fb50a0afd9d067de/org-tufte.el#L102][use of katex instead of mathjax]]
    - [[https://github.com/Zilong-Li/org-tufte/blob/404ab1286139ea6cbdc00bb1fb50a0afd9d067de/org-tufte.el#L87][modified html-template]]
  - [[https://github.com/Zilong-Li/org-tufte/blob/404ab1286139ea6cbdc00bb1fb50a0afd9d067de/org-tufte.el#L97][automated inclusion of css hosted at third-party location]]

=ox-tufte= is still a work-in-progress, but it is being used by at least [[https://weary-travelers.gitlab.io/][one
blog]] in "production". Please open an issue if you discover any bugs!
** Compatibility
Ox-tufte is compatible and tested with
- =tufte-css= [[https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css/releases/tag/v1.8.0][v1.8.0]]
- =org-mode= >= 9.5
- =emacs= >= 27.1

It's worth noting that Emacs 27.1 comes with Org version 9.3 (Org version 9.5
comes with Emacs 28.1), however, it can be updated via Emacs's "package menu"
(M-x list-packages).

Please open issues if you discover any incompatibility!
* Installation and Usage
You can install ox-tufte using [[https://melpa.org][MELPA]]:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)

(package-refresh-contents)
(package-install 'ox-tufte)
#+END_SRC

And then in your ~init.el~ (or equivalent):
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'ox-tufte)
#+END_SRC

It's important that you download [[https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css][tufte css]] ([[https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css/releases/tag/v1.8.0][v1.8.0]]) and place it on your server
(with the fonts).

[[https://repology.org/project/emacs:ox-tufte/versions][file:https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/emacs:ox-tufte.svg]]

** Usage
The recommended way to use =ox-tufte= is *with* [[https://orgmode.org/manual/CSS-support.html][the default style provided by
ox-html]]. Include =tufte.css= followed by =src/ox-tufte.css= (strictly in that
order) in your org-mode document. This can be done by setting [[https://github.com/emacs-straight/org-mode/blob/ca873f7fe47546bca19821f1578a6ab95bf5351c/lisp/ox-html.el#L134][the =:html-head=
option for ox-html]]. This can be done in elisp, or done in the specific
org-mode document by adding a header such as:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/tufte.css" type="text/css" />
  ,#+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/ox-tufte.css" type="text/css" />
#+END_SRC

For usage, when exporting simply select "Tufte HTML" instead of regular HTML
export from the export menu (=C-c C-e=).
* Features
ox-tufte supports *most* of the features from tufte-css, some in different ways
than expected, and some extensions.

** [[https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/#sidenotes][Sidenotes and margin-notes]]
<<footnotes>>Org-mode footnotes become numbered Sidenotes from the tufte
spec. The only limitation (inherited from =tufte-css=) is that a footnote can no
longer include another footnote within.
*** Inline margin-notes
<<marginnotes-inline>>Since, Org-mode doesn't yet support syntax for inline
special blocks ([[https://list.orgmode.org/orgmode/87a6b8pbhg.fsf@posteo.net/][though it's being discussed and may be implemented in the near
future]]), there are multiple ways to express inline margin-notes (i.e.,
margin-notes that can include [[https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#phrasing-content-2][HTML phrasing content]]). Inline margin-notes are
implemented in their most feature-full incarnation as an inline babel call,
specifically, to [[marginnote][the "marginnote" block defined below]].
#+name: marginnote
#+header: :var input=""
#+begin_src elisp :eval yes :exports results :results html replace value
  (require 'ox-tufte)
  (ox-tufte--utils-margin-note input)
#+end_src
If the only content of an inline margin-note is a link to an image, the
generated HTML will be malformed. Use the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Escape-Character.html][zero width space escape character]] to
communicate to the export process that the rendered image is to be contained
within a paragraph. If you need to enforce a line break within the margin-note,
use =\\= at the end of a line as follows:
#+begin_src org
  This is some regular text call_marginnote("this will be a margin note") and some
  more text call_marginnote("another margin note.\\
  new line in second margin note.").
#+end_src
An alternative syntax of an inline margin-note as a macro is also provided with
the following additional (wrt the inline babel call syntax) caveats:
- macro invocations are not permitted in this syntax
- commas need to be escaped with a backslash (=\=)
- line breaks can be enforced by adding an unescaped comma
#+begin_src org
  This is some regular text {{{marginnote(this will be a margin note)}}} and some
  more text {{{marginnote(another margin note.,new line in second margin
  note.)}}}.
#+end_src
If, however, you only need an inline margin-note with some text without
requiring specific control over line breaks or insertion of links or images (but
still allowing for macro and babel call invocation), the margin-note-as-a-link
syntax might be preferable.
- The margin note number is optional and either `mn:1` or `mn:` as below would
  work:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
  This is some regular text [[mn:1][this will be a margin note. while links aren't
  supported, commas don't need escaping.]] and some more text [[mn:][another margin note]].
#+END_SRC
The reason for not being able to insert links (or images) using this syntax is
an org syntax limitation.
*** Block margin-notes
There is also support for "block" margin-notes, which are margin-notes that can
contain "block" elements ([[https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#flow-content-2][HTML spec flow content]]) such as paragraphs, lists,
tables etc. These are defined using an org-mode "marginnote" special-block
(i.e., within =#+begin_marginnote= and =#+end_marginnote=, or within
=#+BEGIN_marginnote= and =#+END_marginnote=).
#+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_marginnote
  This is a block level margin-note.
  - item 1
  - item 2
  ,#+end_marginnote
#+end_src
The block marginnote is displayed to the right side of the paragraph following
it. In case a block margin-note is needed in [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-syntax.html#Zeroth_section][the zeroth section]] (i.e., before
the first heading in an org document), it needs to be wrapped within
=#+begin_zeroth-section= and =#+end_zeroth-section= as follows:
#+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_zeroth-section
  ,#+begin_marginnote
  This is a block level margin-note.
  - item 1
  - item 2
  ,#+end_marginnote
  ,#+end_zeroth-section
#+end_src

** <<epigraphs>>[[https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/#epigraphs][Epigraphs]] and [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Paragraphs.html#index-BEGIN_005fVERSE][quotes]]
- Anything within =#+begin_epigraph= and =#+end_epigraph= becomes an epigraph
  (which is a collection of one or more quoted blocks). For example:
  #+begin_src org
    ,#+begin_epigraph
    ,#+name: quote-1
    ,#+caption: Richard P. Feynman, @@html:<cite>“What Do You Care What Other People Think?”</cite>@@
    ,#+begin_quote
    For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations,
    for Nature cannot be fooled.
    ,#+end_quote

    ,#+name: quote-2
    ,#+caption: Henri Matisse, @@html:<cite>Henri Matisse Dessins: thèmes et variations</cite>@@ (Paris, 1943), 37
    ,#+begin_quote
    I do not paint things, I paint only the differences between things.
    ,#+end_quote
    ,#+end_epigraph
  #+end_src
- =ox-tufte= also adds support for =#+CAPTION= on [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Paragraphs.html#index-BEGIN_005fVERSE][org-mode =quote= and =verse= blocks]].
** <<code>>[[https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/#code][Code]]
=ox-tufte= uses =ox-html= to export [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Literal-Examples.html][code fragments]] to HTML (without any
alteration). =ox-html= and [[https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/htmlize.html][=htmlize=]] allow one to customize the syntax
highlighting of the exported code blocks. An Emacs color theme that is visually
consistent with =tufte-css= is the [[https://melpa.org/#/plan9-theme][=plan9-theme=]] which can be installed from
Melpa via something like:
#+begin_src elisp
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)

  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'plan9-theme)
#+end_src
And then in your =init.el= or equivalent, load it using:
src_elisp{(load-theme 'plan9 t)}.
** <<figures>>Figures and iframes
To use =tufte-css='s =iframe-wrapper= class, one can do something like below:
#+begin_src org
  ,#+ATTR_HTML: :class iframe-wrapper
  ,#+begin_figure
  @@html:<iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YslQ2625TR4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>@@
  ,#+end_figure
#+end_src

To have fullwidth figures:
#+begin_src org
  ,#+ATTR_HTML: :class fullwidth
  ,#+begin_figure
  ,#+CAPTION: Edward Tufte’s English translation of the Napoleon’s March data visualization. From Beautiful Evidence, page 122-124.
  [[https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/img/napoleons-march.png]]
  ,#+end_figure
#+end_src
Alternatively, the =fullwidth= class can also be applied to the image
directly. However, in this case the resulting image may not truly be
"fullwidth".
#+begin_src org
  ,#+ATTR_HTML: :class fullwidth
  ,#+CAPTION: Edward Tufte’s English translation of the Napoleon’s March data visualization. From Beautiful Evidence, page 122-124.
  [[https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/img/napoleons-march.png]]
#+end_src
Experiment and choose depending on your application.
** <<quilts>>ImageQuilts
=tufte-css= has a notion of image quilts. [[https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/#imagequilts][the examples on tufte-css website]] are
single images that were created by combining multiple images. However, that
processing was done before linking via html. It's unclear what, if any,
conveniences =tufte-css= provides for image quilts (over and above other
features, since [[figures][single images can already be included as desired]]).

However, in =ox-tufte= one can create a figure with multiple images.
#+begin_src org
  ,#+HTML_HEAD_EXTRA: <style> .quiltish img { max-height: 200px; min-height: 100px; } </style>
  ,#+attr_html: :class quiltish
  ,#+CAPTION: caption for multiple images
  ,#+begin_figure
  [[./path/to/img1.png]]
  [[./path/to/img2.png]]
  ,#+end_figure
#+end_src
** Deviations and Extensions (from =tufte-css= and =ox-html=)
*** Sections and Headings
- =h4= heading level is supported in a consistent manner similar to =h3=.
*** Epigraphs
Epigraphs and quotes by default occupy only the width of the main content. In
order to get quoted content that extends for the fullwidth add the =fullwidth=
class with an =#+attr_html= annotation.
*** Sidenotes and margin-notes
- =tufte-css= numbers sidenotes via CSS and as such referring to the same
  sidenote more than once results in erroneous numbering. =ox-tufte= fixes
  this.
- Block margin-notes are supported via src_org{#+begin_marginnote} and
  src_org{#+end_marginnote}.
*** Figures
- Captions on images are placed below the image (as opposed to in the margin
  area) regardless of whether the image is =fullwidth= or not.
*** Code
- Since code blocks cannot have footnotes/sidenotes in them, they are treated as
  if they were using the "fullwidth" class (without having to specify the class
  via =#+attr_html=).
*** ImageQuilts
- Unlike =ox-html=, in =ox-tufte= captions on figure special-blocks (the kind
  used when including multiple images in a block, as in ImageQuilts) are
  included as figcaptions. *Limitation:* presently the included caption doesn't
  include automated numbering.
** Experimental
There may be some experimental extensions in =src/ox-tufte-experimental.css=.
If desired, this css file should be included /after/ =src/ox-tufte.css=.
* Limitations
** Incompatibility with =org-info.js=
The generated HTML is not compatible with [[https://orgmode.org/worg/code/org-info-js/][org-info.js]]. This is because
=ox-tufte= customizes the value of =org-html-divs= to align it with what's
expected by =tufte-css=.
** Code blocks are only fullwidth
Code blocks (multiline) currently behave /only/ in a "fullwidth" manner. I.e.,
if there is sidenote content from previous paragraph, or a block margin-note it
will push the code block down.
** Constraints inherited from =tufte-css=
Additionally, =ox-tufte= presently inherits the following limitations from
[[https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/][tufte-css]]:
- Footnotes/sidenotes cannot contain nested footnotes/sidenotes.
- Sidenotes cannot contain paragraphs, tables etc. (since they are HTML =span=
  elements).
- Captions for =iframe-wrapper= blocks aren't supported.
- The generated HTML must (and does) use an =html5= doctype.
** Incompatibility with =org-special-block-extras=
As of [2024-01-12 Fri], =org-special-block-extras= is incompatible with
=ox-tufte=.  As noted in [[https://github.com/ox-tufte/ox-tufte/issues/20#issuecomment-1880626278][this comment]], the incompatibility is primarily due to
hard-coded checks in =org-special-block-extras= which are too restrictive and
need to be relaxed.
* Customization
** Footnotes section at bottom
The behaviour depends on the =:footnotes-section-p= option (which uses the value
of ~org-tufte-include-footnotes-at-bottom~ as default).

Because footnotes are transformed to sidenotes they are currently hidden on very
narrow screens (like phones), unless the use manually toggles visibility for
each reference. if you want to include footnotes *also* at the bottom of the
page, this may be set to =t= using =setq=:
#+begin_src elisp
  (require 'ox-tufte)
  (setq org-tufte-include-footnotes-at-bottom t)
#+end_src
Or, if you're using =use-package=:
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package ox-tufte
    :config
    (setq org-tufte-include-footnotes-at-bottom t))
#+end_src

This behaviour can also be configured on a per-file basis using:
#+begin_src org
  ,#+OPTIONS: footnotes-section-p:t
#+end_src
Or, (assuming =org-export-allow-bind-keywords= is =t=) using below:
#+begin_src org
  ,#+BIND: org-tufte-include-footnotes-at-bottom t
#+end_src
** Margin-note symbol and visibility on small screens
From [[https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/][tufte-css]]:
#+begin_quote
However, on small screens, a margin note is like a sidenote except its
viewability-toggle is a symbol rather than a reference number. This document
currently uses the symbol ⊕ (&#8853;), but it’s up to you.
#+end_quote
This symbol can be tweaked, by modifying the value of
=org-tufte-margin-note-symbol=. Specifically, if this value is set to the empty
string (=""=), then margin-notes are always hidden on small screens.
** Color of margin-note visibility-toggle and footnote-references
Margin-note visibility color toggle can be tweaked using something like
#+begin_src css
  label.margin-toggle {
      color: #a00000;
  }
#+end_src

For footnote references, something like below would work
#+begin_src css
  label.sidenote-number,
  .sidenote > sup.numeral {
      color: #a00000;
  }
#+end_src
